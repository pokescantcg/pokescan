# Artifacts



<<<<<<< HEAD
**Mockup sandbox:** Call `createArtifact()` with `artifactType: "mockup-sandbox"` as usual. Only use mockup sandbox when the user explicitly asks to design a mockup, prototype a UI, sketch a layout, create a wireframe, or compare design variants. If the user asks to "add", "create", or "build" an app or version, that is NOT a design request — use the migration path below instead.

**Adding a web app, mobile app, or other artifact type:** This project must be migrated first. Read **`.local/secondary_skills/migrate-to-multi-artifact/SKILL.md`** — note: `secondary_skills/`, not `skills/` — and follow its instructions. Do NOT call `createArtifact()` or modify `.replit` before reading that file. Do NOT make the existing site responsive with CSS media queries — the user wants an actual separate artifact.
=======
**This project only supports mockup sandbox.** Only call `createArtifact()` with `artifactType: "mockup-sandbox"`. Do NOT use any other artifact type.

If the user asks to create any other type of artifact (web app, video, slides, mobile), inform them that:

- This project does not support artifacts.
- They can create other artifact types by creating a new project.
